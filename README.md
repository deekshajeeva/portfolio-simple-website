# portfolio-simple-website
My portfolio website is built using HTML to structure sections like the header, about, projects, and contact form, while CSS is used to style the layout with colors, fonts, and spacing. The black-and-orange theme and box designs are created with CSS classes, giving the site a clean, professional look.
