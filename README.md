# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website. My portfolio website is built using HTML to structure sections like the header, about, projects, and contact form, while CSS is used to style the layout with colors, fonts, and spacing. The black-and-orange theme and box designs are created with CSS classes, giving the site a clean, professional look.

It includes two main pages — **Home** and **Contact** — designed to introduce myself and provide a way for visitors to reach out.

---

##  Pages

* **Home Page:** A short introduction and overview of my work.
* **Contact Page:** A simple form or contact details to get in touch.

---

##  Technologies Used

* **HTML** – for website structure
* **CSS** – for design and styling

Would you like me to add a **preview image** section (like a screenshot of your homepage) to make the README more attractive for GitHub?
